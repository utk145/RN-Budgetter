    * Login using social media platforms (Kind authentication)
    * User profile management (optional)
* **Budget Management:**
    * Create budget categories with custom names, colors, and icons.
    * Set budget amount for each category.
    * Add new items with cost details and optional images to specific categories.
    * View category details with progress bar reflecting spending against the budget.
    * Delete categories.
* **Data Management:**
    * Securely store user data, budget categories, items, and images.
    * Retrieve and display user data, categories, and items.
* **UI/UX:**
    * User-friendly interface with a home screen displaying user profile and a donut chart for budget visualization.
    * Ability to add new categories and items with clear and intuitive interactions.
    * Progress bar for each category to visually track spending.
    * Option to delete categories and refresh the screen.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security:**
    * Implement secure social login using Kind authentication.
    * Securely store user data and images.
* **Performance:**
    * Ensure fast loading times and smooth navigation within the app.
* **Scalability:**
    * The app should be able to handle an increasing number of users and data without performance degradation.
* **Offline Functionality (Optional):**
    * Allow users to view budget categories and potentially add items even without an internet connection (data might be synced later).


## Step-by-Step Process (Simplified)

1. **Set Up Development Environment:**
    * Install necessary tools like React Native, Expo, Supabase client library, and Kind SDK.
2. **Develop User Interface (UI):**
    * Design and build the login screen with social login options.
    * Create the home screen with user profile and donut chart for budget visualization.
    * Implement functionalities for adding/editing/deleting categories and items with user-friendly interfaces.
3. **Integrate Backend with Supabase:**
    * Set up a Supabase project and configure authentication.
    * Design database schema to store user data, budget categories, items, and images.
    * Develop functions to interact with Supabase for data storage and retrieval.
4. **Implement App Logic:**
    *  Write code to handle user login/logout.
    *  Develop logic for adding, editing, and deleting categories and items.
    *  Implement functionalities for managing budget calculations and progress bar updates.
    *  Connect UI interactions with appropriate backend functions.
5. **Testing and Deployment:**
    * Thoroughly test the app functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
    * Deploy the app to the desired platform (e.g., App Store, Google Play Store) using Expo.

**Note:** This is a simplified step-by-step process. The actual development process might involve additional steps and functionalities depending on specific requirements.
